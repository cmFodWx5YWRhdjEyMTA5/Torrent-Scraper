I want a complex torrent scraping bot programmed in Python.

It needs to be able to browse, scrape, and collect the following information in a CSV file. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values

Name, Date Created/Added, Size, Number of Seeds, Magnet/Hash

These are the sites I need it to scrape.

https://rarbg.to/torrents.php

I want it to be fast. So if I need to buy paid proxies I will

Bot should support proxy lists in order to avoid being banned.

Bot should be programmed in Python & turned into an easy to use exe when done.

You can do this with http://www.pyinstaller.org or https://pypi.org/project/py2exe/0.9.2.0/

Also, I forgot to mention, after its done scraping, it should check for duplicates by comparing magnet/hash and remove any duplicates.

Bot should also remove any listings that don't have at least 1 seed.
